## Application Email Template

**Subject:** Sandbox Access Request - Aetheria Vault Crypto Card Program (TON Integration)

**To:** partnerships@striga.com, support@striga.com

**Body:**

---

Hi Striga Team,

I've just signed up for your sandbox and would like to accelerate access for our crypto card program targeting Telegram's 200M+ crypto users.

## Project Overview
**Aetheria Vault** - Telegram-native crypto platform with integrated virtual cards and curated investment vaults

## Key Requirements
- **Virtual card issuance API** for Telegram Mini App integration
- **TON Connect wallet support** (Telegram's exclusive blockchain protocol)
- **MiCA compliance framework** for EU market expansion
- **Real-time transaction monitoring** for user analytics
- **USDC_TON integration** for seamless crypto-to-card conversion

## Technical Specifications
- **Platform:** Telegram Mini App (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **Wallet Integration:** TON Connect (meets Telegram's 2025 requirements)
- **User Base:** Crypto enthusiasts aged 20-35 in Europe
- **Launch Timeline:** Beta testing in 2-3 weeks
- **Expected Volume:** 50-100 initial users, scaling to 1,000+ monthly active

## Competitive Advantage
We're evaluating Striga against Stripe Issuing and Ramp Network, but your crypto-native approach and TON ecosystem support make you the ideal partner for Telegram's crypto community.

## Immediate Needs
1. Sandbox API access for development
2. Technical documentation for TON integration
3. Card program approval timeline
4. Revenue model details (FX spreads vs interchange)

## Next Steps
Can we schedule a technical call this week to discuss integration requirements and timeline? Our development team is ready to implement immediately upon sandbox access.

Looking forward to partnering with Striga for this innovative Telegram-native card program.

Best regards,
